# PlugShareAnonymous
Userscript to allow using PlugShare without an account


PlugShareAnonymous, or PSA, removes the persistent login window that appears on the plugshare website.  This window can be dismissed for the first few page visits in a session, but becomes persistent after around five page visits.  This script simply removes the login dialog and loads the PlugShare map, allowing use of the PlugShare website without an account.
